  "aboutJyotish15" : "What is the right path for someone with certain qualities?",
  "aboutJyotish16" : "The purpose of Jyotish astrology is to shed light on our individual destiny.",
  "aboutJyotish17" : "Astrology originated in Mesopotamia about 4,000 years ago, from where it spread to India and Greece. The Greek branch is known as western astrology and the Indian branch as Jyotish. The Western and Eastern uses different coordinates, which makes the charts of the two astrologies drastically different.",
  "aboutJyotish18" : "The Vedas were the source of the philosophy that formed the basis of Vedic astrology Jyotish, it is the Vedas that specify the rules for reading the natal chart. Vedas is a collection of philosophical metaphorical texts about the laws of nature and creation, about the meaning of life, Dharma and how to achieve human happiness. The Vedas are complex texts that tell epic stories of the lives, joys, troubles, victories and defeats of heroes. Later, with the rise of the religion of Hinduism, the texts of the Vedas came to be considered sacred scriptures, the heroes of the stories were appointed gods and a cult was formed around them. It so happened that Jyotish astrology and the religion of Hinduism came from one source, the Vedas, and therefore Jyotish and religion became almost equal, although true Jyotish astrology has nothing to do with religion and is intended for secular purposes.",
  "aboutJyotish19" : "In ancient times, astrology could only be used to its full potential by members of the highest ranks of society. For them, for the most part, it served. Astrology helped them understand how a lord, commander, or ruler could increase their power. That is, astrology helped them develop their purpose. The upper classes had few restrictions: economic, territorial, and mental, because they could be educated and expand. In those ancient times, only members of the higher estates had opportunities to realize themselves in accordance with their horoscopes, while in the modern world, all people, regardless of their origin, have the opportunity to realize their strong positions in the charts.",
  "aboutJyotish20" : "At a time when opportunities for ordinary people were severely limited, foretelling astrology was born. The worldview foundation of predictive astrology is static life, small opportunities for development and almost hopelessness of existence of ordinary man. Then appeared the tradition of chanting mantras to supposedly harmonize the planets, because chanting sacred songs allows to alleviate the suffering resulting from the inability to realize the strong positions in the chart. Times have changed, life is different and predictive astrology no longer works. Today every one of us can use every single active position in our natal chart and have a positive outcome, even in those houses supported by planets that were not favored by the old-style astrologers who were wary of Saturn, Mars, the Sun, and the lunar nodes of Rahu and Ketu. The good news is that Saturn and Rahu no longer foretell a hard life for us. We just need to know how to realize the challenging positions in our natal chart.",
  "aboutJyotish21" : "The untruthfulness of predictive astrology in our time is confirmed by extensive statistical studies, produced first by Michel Gauclain and then by Andre Barbot. The predictive element in astrology comes true with only a 25-40% probability, as statistics have shown. While the correspondence of a person's character to the positions in the natal chart, according to various studies, is 75-85%.",
  "aboutJyotish22" : "Jyotish astrology helps to answer the questions: what am I born to do? what am I inclined to do? what is important to me? how can this important be realized? what is essential to me that I refuse to look at? what am I underdeveloped to be happy? what is my destiny? what Path is right for me?",
  "aboutJyotish23" : "The natal chart even allows you to make a diagnosis of health and find the causes of disease, which is what Ayurveda does. When one does not realize the strong positions in one's chart, diseases begin. It is a mistake to think of diseases as punishment. Illnesses are when the potential in a person (in fact, energy) is forced to collapse into the body without being applied to a suitable activity, provoking illness.",
  "aboutJyotish24" : "The natal chart is a mathematical model of our psyche. Vedic astrology metaphorically, through houses and planets, tells us how our personality is structured, what is in our genes, what we are inclined to do, what people suit us as spouses, lovers, teachers, business partners. A good astrologer will find several sub-personalities in your chart (components of the personality, each with its own needs and interests) and, by giving them a common task, will deduce a purpose, which includes work, family, relationships, money, and many other things.",
  "aboutJyotish25" : "People who are born at the same time and have the same chart will have different purposes. The reason for this is because the natal chart is superimposed on our interests, abilities, cultural and family background. The same position in the chart will have different meanings for different people. For example, one person with Mercury in the house of vocation needs to be a writer, another a financier, a third a music teacher, a fourth a computer programmer, a fifth something else, and so on and so forth a thousand variations. So it is very important that the astrologer ask the person about everything that makes up their life and thinking. It is impossible to get deep enough into a person in less than 1-2 hours to deduce their exact destiny. The astrologer's interpretation of the chart, based on a superficial preliminary analysis of the client, is also superficial.",
  "aboutJyotish26" : "The Jyotish natal chart contains 12 houses, each of which symbolizes a certain area of life. There are 9 grahas in the houses: 5 planets (Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Saturn and Mercury), 2 luminaries (Moon and Sun) and two lunar nodes, which are mathematical points and do not exist in reality (Rahu and Ketu). Each of the planets is a symbol of a set of certain qualities and characteristics. Spheres of life are realized in accordance with these qualities. Houses in which planets stand are very important in human life, their non-realization leads to diseases, mental problems and all kinds of failures.",
  "aboutJyotish27" : "The Saturn.Love chart decoding allows you to get in touch with the world of modern and applied Vedic astrology, Jyotish. Inside, you'll find many details about the structure of your life, and you'll understand what you need to work through and with what specifics. The calculation contains many valuable hints.
